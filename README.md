<h1>Requirements</h1>
1. <b>PyAutoGUI</b><br>
2. <b>Pyfiglet</b><br>
3. <b>Screen Size 1366 x 768</b><br>
<br>

<h1>How to use</h1>
First of all this is the last tool you should use to automate Instagram likes becuase this isn't effectient tool if we compare to other tools present over insternet, but I didn't liked them becuase of frequent errors and old version dosen't support latest Instagram website. 
<br>
1. First go to Instagram an search for tag you want to like post with.(So that it loads the webpage of that tag for example: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/html5/ and when bot opens search for this tag preloaded data will open it fast)<br>
2. Now load home page of Instagram and split it in left side of window.<br>
3. Now run main.py using python in CMD(recommended) if you want to use other programs they you would face errors which won't affect Insu but likes counter will not work properly. <br>
4. Get CMD split in right side of window. like this:- <br>
