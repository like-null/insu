# Insu
Instagram bot. Which like recent posts using tags to increase the reach of the Instagram account because many people who get 2 to 3 likes will surely check you who liked them.

<h1>Intro</h1>
INSU is an Instagram bot that manually likes posts using tags, by controlling mouse clicks and keyboard keys. It uses pyautogui to do this, And to use it your screen size should be 1366 x 768, which you can easily set using your windows display settings.
<br>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
1. Python 3<br>
2. <b>PyAutoGUI</b><br>
3. <b>Pyfiglet</b><br>
4. <b>Screen Size 1366 x 768</b><br>
<br>

<h1>How to use</h1>
First of all, this is the last tool you should use to automate Instagram likes because this isn't an efficient tool if we compare it to other tools present over the internet, but I didn't like them because of frequent errors and the old version doesn't support latest Instagram website.
<br><br>
1. First go to Instagram and search for the tag in which you want to like posts.<br><i>So that it loads the webpage of that tag for example: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/html5/ and when bot opens search for this tag preloaded data will open it fast)<br></i>
<br>
2. Now load the home page of Instagram and split it on the left side of the window.<br>
<br>
3. Now run main.py using python in CMD(recommended) if you want to use other programs you would face errors that won't affect Insu but like counter will not work properly.<br>
<br>
4. Get CMD split on the right side of the window. like this:-<br><br>

5. Enter how many posts you want to like and then enter the one tag (ex: #html) and keep in mind that you have pre-loaded that tag in your Instagram.<br><br>
6. Now leave your computer or pc it will work on its own. <br><br>

It will browse through Instagram step by step from searching tag to scrolling to the recent post and then it will start liking posts by tag, and you can also see how many posts it liked and to close just use ctrl+c or let it finish work then it will close automatically.
<br>
<h1>Conclusion.</h1>
This is not a very effective way as you can see but still, if you set it up then you can easily use it for long period as updates of Instagram will not affect this and you don't need to provide your ID and Password to any python file and it will look like more legit to Instagram because <b>Insu</b> will be operating manually, using clicks and keys.
<br>
You will struggle while using it for the first time but after that, you can see how much easy it is to use. But still, this was not the very professional to do that, it was just a project for me as I wanted to play with PyAutoGUI.
